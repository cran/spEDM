## Model principles

Let us begin by defining two spatial cross-sectional series $\{x_s\}_{s \in S}$ and $\{y_s\}_{s \in S}$, where $S$ represents the study area.

We use:

$$
\mathcal{X}_W = \{ W_i x \mid W_i \in \mathcal{W}(x, y) \}
$$

$$
\mathcal{Y}_W = \{ W_i y \mid W_i \in \mathcal{W}(x, y) \}
$$

to denote the sets of spatial lags of $x$ and $y$ given by all the weighting matrices in $\mathcal{W}(x, y)$(that is the set of spatial
dependence structures between $x$ and $y$).


We say that $\{x_s\}_{s \in S}$ does not cause $\{y_s\}_{s \in S}$ **under the spatial structures** $\mathcal{X}_W$ and $\mathcal{Y}_W$ if

$$
h_{y |\mathcal{Y}_W}(m) = h_{y | \mathcal{Y}_W,\mathcal{X}_W}(m)
$$
A unilateral non-parametric test can be applied to assess the spatial causality via the following null hypothesis:

$$
H_0 : \{x_s\}_{s \in S} \text{ does not cause } \{y_s\}_{s \in S} \text{ under the spatial structures } \mathcal{X}_W \text{ and } \mathcal{Y}_W, $$

with the following statistic:

$$
\hat{\delta}(\mathcal{Y}_W, \mathcal{X}_W) = \hat{h}_{y |\mathcal{Y}_W}(m) - \hat{h}_{y | \mathcal{Y}_W,\mathcal{X}_W}(m)
$$

where $\hat{h}_*(m)$ is the estimated conditional symbolic entropy using Shannonâ€™s entropy with $m-1$ nearest neighbors. The alternative is that the null hypothesis of is not true.

If $\mathcal{X}_W$ does not contain extra information about $y$ then $\hat{\delta}(\mathcal{Y}_W, \mathcal{X}_W) = 0$, otherwise, $ \hat{\delta}(\mathcal{Y}_W, \mathcal{X}_W) > 0$.

$h_{y |\mathcal{Y}_W}(m)$ measures the uncertainty of the distribution of symbols of $y$, conditional to the symbols of its spatial lag, $ \mathcal{Y}_W$. Moreover, $h_{y | \mathcal{Y}_W,\mathcal{X}_W}(m)$ measures the uncertainty of the distribution of symbols of $y$, conditional to the symbols of the spatial lags of $y$, $\mathcal{Y}_W$, and of $x$, $ \mathcal{X}_W$. If the second variable, $x$, indeed causes the first one then there should be a significant decrease in the entropy, and the statistic $\hat{\delta}(\mathcal{Y}_W, \mathcal{X}_W)$ will take on high positive values. If there is only a spatial correlation, but not causation, the difference between both entropies will be small. The statistical significance of $\hat{\delta}(\mathcal{Y}_W, \mathcal{X}_W)$ is assessed using spatial block bootstrap.

## Usage examples

### An example of spatial lattice data

Load the `spEDM` package and the columbus OH dataset:

```{r load_lattice_data}
library(spEDM)

columbus = sf::read_sf(system.file("case/columbus.gpkg", package="spEDM"))
columbus
```

Detect spatial causality among the variables *inc*, *crime*, and *hoval* :

```{r case_lattice}
# house value and crime
sc.test(columbus, "hoval", "crime", k = 15)

# household income and crime
sc.test(columbus, "inc", "crime", k = 15)

# household income and house value
sc.test(columbus, "inc", "hoval", k = 15)
```

### An example of spatial grid data

Load the `spEDM` package and its farmland NPP data:

```{r load_grid_data}
library(spEDM)

npp = terra::rast(system.file("case/npp.tif", package = "spEDM"))
# To save the computation time, we will aggregate the data by 3 times
npp = terra::aggregate(npp, fact = 3, na.rm = TRUE)
npp
```

Detect spatial causality among the variables *pre*, *tem*, and *npp* :

```{r case_grid}
# precipitation and npp
sc.test(npp,"pre","npp",k = 30)

# temperature and npp
sc.test(npp,"tem","npp",k = 30)

# precipitation and temperature
sc.test(npp,"pre","tem",k = 30)
```
