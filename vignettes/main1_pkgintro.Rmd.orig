## Overview

The *spEDM* package is an open-source, computationally efficient toolkit designed to provide a unified API for **Spatial Empirical Dynamic Modeling**. It supports a suite of prediction-based causal discovery algorithms, including *spatial (granger) causality test*, *geographical convergent cross mapping*, *geographical pattern causality*, *geographical cross mapping cardinality*, and *spatially convergent partial cross mapping*.

To support both learning and practical application, *spEDM* offers four carefully curated spatial cross-sectional datasets, each paired with a detailed example showcasing the use of key algorithms in the package.

## Installation

Install the stable version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spEDM) with:

```r
install.packages("spEDM", dep = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from [R-universe](https://stscl.r-universe.dev/spEDM) with:

```r
install.packages("spEDM",
                 repos = c("https://stscl.r-universe.dev",
                           "https://cloud.r-project.org"),
                 dep = TRUE)
```

## Data

The *spEDM* package includes three illustrative datasets with well-known causation to demonstrate key functionalities:

1. **Columbus, OH** dataset — A classic spatial dataset widely used in spatial econometrics, included here for benchmarking and demonstration purposes.
   *Data files*: `columbus.gpkg`

2. **Population density and its potential drivers in mainland China** — A county-level dataset capturing population density alongside relevant socio-environmental drivers.
   *Data files*: `popd.csv`, `popd_nb.gal`

3. **Farmland NPP and related variables** — A raster dataset capturing farmland net primary productivity (NPP), key climatic variables, elevation, and human activity footprints across mainland China, suitable for analyzing the interactions between agricultural productivity, environmental conditions, and human activities.
   *Data files*: `npp.tif`

These datasets can be loaded as shown below:

### Columbus OH spatial analysis dataset

```{r columbus}
library(spEDM)

columbus = sf::read_sf(system.file("case/columbus.gpkg", package="spEDM"))
columbus
```

### County-level population density in mainland China

```{r popd}
library(spEDM)

popd_nb = spdep::read.gal(system.file("case/popd_nb.gal",package = "spEDM"))
popd_nb

popd = readr::read_csv(system.file("case/popd.csv",package = "spEDM"))
popd

popd_sf = sf::st_as_sf(popd, coords = c("lon","lat"), crs = 4326)
popd_sf
```

### Farmland NPP and related variables in mainland China

```{r npp}
library(spEDM)
npp = terra::rast(system.file("case/npp.tif", package = "spEDM"))
npp
```

In addition to the spatial extensions provided by *spEDM*, several other R packages support Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) for **time series data**:

* **[tEDM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tEDM)**: An R package developed by the author of `spEDM`, designed to implement the **Temporal Empirical Dynamic Modeling** framework. It aims for maximal consistency with `spEDM` in terms of API design and modeling workflow, facilitating seamless transition between spatial and temporal EDM applications.
* **[rEDM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rEDM)**: A foundational EDM package implementing simplex projection, S-map, and convergent cross mapping (CCM), widely used for analyzing nonlinear time series dynamics.
* **[multispatialCCM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=multispatialCCM)**: Implements CCM for collections of short time series using bootstrapping, enabling causal inference across replicated or multi-site time series.
* **[fastEDM](https://edm-developers.github.io/fastEDM-r/)**: A high-performance EDM package with a multi-threaded C++ backend. It supports large-scale time series analysis, handles panel data, and provides robust options for dealing with missing values using delay-tolerant algorithms or data exclusion.
