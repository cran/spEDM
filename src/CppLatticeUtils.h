/**
 * Computes the lagged neighbors for a lattice structure up to a specified lag number.
 * This function recursively expands the neighbors at each lag step, starting with direct neighbors
 * (lag 0), and including neighbors from previous lags, until reaching the specified lag number.
 *
 * For lagNum = 0, each spatial unit is its own neighbor.
 * For lagNum >= 1, the function accumulates neighbors from all previous lags and deduplicates the results.
 * Empty results are filled with `std::numeric_limits<int>::min()` to indicate no neighbors.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   spNeighbor - A 2D vector where each element contains indices of immediate neighbors for each spatial unit.
 *   lagNum     - The number of lag steps to compute (must be non-negative).
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A 2D vector where each element represents the list of lagged neighbors for a spatial unit.

/**
 * Computes the lagged values for a given vector based on the neighborhood structure and lag number.
 * This function first determines the lagged neighbors for each spatial unit using

 *
 * For each spatial unit, the function extracts values from `vec` corresponding to the computed
 * lagged neighbors. If no valid neighbors exist, the function fills the result with `NaN`.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   vec    - A vector of double values representing the spatial data for each unit.
 *   nb     - A 2D vector where each row contains indices of immediate neighbors in the lattice.

/**
 * @brief Generate a list of k nearest neighbors for each spatial location based on lattice connectivity.
 *
 * This function constructs neighborhood information for each element in a spatial process
 * using both direct connectivity and value similarity. It ensures that each location has
 * at least k unique neighbors by expanding through its neighbors' neighbors recursively,
 * if necessary. All neighbors must be indices present in the provided `lib` vector.
 *
 * The procedure consists of:
 * 1. Starting with directly connected neighbors from `nb` that are also in `lib`.
 * 2. If fewer than k unique neighbors are found, iteratively expand the neighborhood using
 *    a breadth-first search (BFS) on the adjacency list (only considering nodes in `lib`).
 * 3. Among all collected neighbors, the function selects the k most similar ones in terms of
 *    absolute value difference from the center location.
 *
 * @param vec A vector of values representing the spatial process (used for sorting by similarity).
 * @param nb A list of adjacency lists where `nb[i]` gives the direct neighbors of location i.
 * @param lib A vector of indices representing valid neighbors to consider for all locations.
 * @param k The desired number of neighbors for each location.
 *
 * @return A vector of vectors, where each subvector contains the indices of the k nearest neighbors
 *         for each location, based on lattice structure and value similarity.
 *
 * @throw std::runtime_error If any location cannot find enough valid neighbors from `lib` to meet the k requirement.
 * @throw std::invalid_argument If `lib` contains invalid indices outside the range of `vec`.

/**
 * @brief Generate symbolization values for a spatial cross-sectional series using a lattice-based

 *
 * This function implements a symbolic transformation of a univariate spatial process,
 * where each spatial location is associated with a value from the original series and
 * its surrounding neighborhood. The symbolization is based on comparing local median-based
 * indicators within a defined spatial neighborhood.
 *
 * The procedure follows three main steps:
 * 1. Compute the global median of the input series `vec`.
 * 2. For each location in `pred`, define a binary indicator (`tau_s`) which is 1 if the value
 *    at that location is greater than or equal to the median, and 0 otherwise.
 * 3. For each location in `pred`, compare its indicator with those of its k nearest neighbors.
 *    The final symbolic value is the count of neighbors that share the same indicator value.
 *
 * @param vec A vector of double values representing the spatial process.
 * @param nb A nested vector containing neighborhood information (e.g., lattice connectivity).
 * @param lib A vector of indices representing valid neighbors to consider for each location.
 * @param pred A vector of indices specifying which elements to compute the symbolization for.
 * @param k The number of nearest neighbors to consider for each location.
 *
 * @return A vector of symbolic values (as double) for each spatial location specified in `pred`.
