/**
 * Computes the multi-view embedding by evaluating multiple feature embeddings using simplex projection,
 * selecting top-performing embeddings, and aggregating their contributions.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   - vectors: 2D vector where each row represents a sample and each column a feature.
 *   - target: Target spatial cross sectional series aligned with the samples in vectors.
 *   - lib_indices: Boolean flag indicating which samples to use for neighbor search.
 *   - pred_indices: Boolean flag indicating which samples to predict.
 *   - num_neighbors: Number of neighbors used for simplex projection.
 *   - top_num: Number of top-performing reconstructions to select.
 *   - threads: Number of threads used from the global pool.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   A vector<double> where each element is the predict value from selected embeddings columns.
