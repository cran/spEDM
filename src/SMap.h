/*
 * Computes the 'S-Maps' prediction.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   - vectors: Reconstructed state-space (each row is a separate vector/state).
 *   - target: Spatial cross-section series to be used as the target (should align with vectors).
 *   - lib_indices: Vector of T/F values (which states to include when searching for neighbors).
 *   - pred_indices: Vector of T/F values (which states to predict from).
 *   - num_neighbors: Number of neighbors to use for S-Map.
 *   - theta: Weighting parameter for distances.
 *
 * Returns: A vector<double> containing the predicted target values.
