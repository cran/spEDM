/**
 * @brief Perform grid-based symbolization on a 2D numeric matrix using local neighborhood statistics.
 *
 * This function calculates a symbolic representation (`fs`) for each non-NaN grid cell based on its
 * k most similar neighbors in terms of value difference. The process expands radially (Queen's case)
 * around each cell until at least k valid neighbors are collected. The final symbol for each cell
 * reflects its local homogeneity pattern relative to the global median.
 *
 * The steps include:
 * 1. Flatten the matrix to compute the global median `s_me` using all valid values.
 * 2. For each grid cell:
 *    - Find up to k nearest neighbors by increasing the neighborhood lag until k valid neighbors are found.
 *    - Sort neighbors by absolute difference in value from the center cell.
 *    - Select the top k values and compute a first indicator vector (`tau_s`) by comparing to global median.
 *    - Compute a second indicator vector (`l_s`) by comparing `tau_s[i]` to the center cellâ€™s own indicator (`taus`).
 *    - Sum `l_s` to get a symbolic value `fs` representing the symbolic spatial consistency.
 *
 * @param mat A 2D grid (matrix) of values to be symbolized. `NaN` values are treated as missing.
 * @param lib Valid library locations as (row,col) pairs
 * @param pred Prediction locations to process as (row,col) pairs
 * @param k The number of neighbors to consider for the symbolization of each cell.
 *
 * @return A flattened 1D vector representing the symbolic values of for prediction locations (row-major order).
 *         Cells with no valid value or insufficient neighbors remain as `NaN`.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Uses Queen's neighborhood definition for expanding neighborhoods (8 directions per layer).
 * - Grid edges and missing values are handled robustly during expansion.
 * - Useful for symbolic dynamics, pattern analysis, or spatial entropy estimation.

/**
 * @brief Divide a 2D grid (matrix) into approximately square or shaped blocks.
 *
 * This function partitions a 2D matrix into `b` blocks of roughly equal size.
 * The matrix is represented as a vector of row vectors and assumed to be
 * row-major (i.e., each inner vector represents a row of the matrix).
 *
 * The grid can be divided in different ways based on the `shape` parameter:
 * - 1: Horizontal cuts (blocks are divided row-wise).
 * - 2: Vertical cuts (blocks are divided column-wise).
 * - 3: Radial cuts (blocks are divided in a radial pattern from the center).
 *
 * The grid is divided by first estimating a grid layout of `br` rows and `bc` columns
 * such that br * bc >= b and the blocks are as square as possible for shapes 1 and 2.
 * For radial cuts, the grid is divided into concentric rings and sectors.
 *
 * Each cell in the matrix is assigned a block ID ranging from 0 to b-1, stored in
 * a 1D vector corresponding to the flattened row-major order of the matrix.
 *
 * Any leftover blocks are merged into the last block.
 *
 * @param mat A 2D grid represented as a vector of vectors (row-major).
 * @param b   Number of blocks to divide the grid into.
 * @param shape The shape of the cuts (1: horizontal, 2: vertical, 3: radial).
 * @return A vector of size rows * cols where each element is the block label
 *         assigned to the corresponding cell.
